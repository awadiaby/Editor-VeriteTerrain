File system,Sparse files,Block suballocation,Tail packing,Extents,Variable file block sizename=note-41 Variable block size refers to systems which support different block sizes on a per-file basis. (This is similar to extents but a slightly different implementational choice.) The current implementation in UFS2 is read-only.,Allocate-on-flush,Copy on write,Trim support

The overhead of managing suballocation block chains is usually less than the amount of block overhead saved by being able to increase the block size but the process is less efficient if there is not much free disk space.,,,,,,
