The last 1/8 of its memory (0.5 GiB on a 4 GiB card) is accessed on a non-interleaved solitary 32-bit connection at 28 GB/s, one seventh the speed of the rest of the memory space. Because this smaller memory pool uses the same connection as the 7th lane to the larger main pool, it contends with accesses to the larger block reducing the effective memory bandwidth not adding to it as an independent connection could.[71]",196.3 + 28.0name=GTX960MemoryMess,,224 + 32name=GTX960MemoryMess,58.8 65.9,109.2 122.5,3?494.4 3?920.3,109.2 122.5,145,4-way SLI,$329
